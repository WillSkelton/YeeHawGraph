## What's with the name?
Simply put, cowboy/western slang terms (eg yee haw, rootin tootin, Plumb tuckered out) are really funny to me and they're my go-to whenever I can't think of another name. I was having a really good time in my Graph Theory class and I was inspired to make a application that:

- Helped me with my homework
- Could count as my final project
- Shows off what I can make with React when there are no grades or requirements and I can kind of "jam"
- Help other people see how neat graphs can be

The phrase "Yee haw" just comes from my enthusiasm about this particular "genre" of math.

## What is it?

Yeehaw graph is a simple graph editor application that's made with React.js and the library [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/). There is an adjacency matrix that can be edited to create clean and aesthetically pleasing graphs with very little hassle. 

Really, I made it to help me with my homework because this is how my brain works and I put it online in case other people can use it to learn.

## I'm Here Because This was Listed as a Portfolio

In a sense, this is my portfolio. While not a list of projects (you can find that on my github), this project serves as an example of what I can do when I'm coding for fun.
